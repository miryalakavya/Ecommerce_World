# Ecommerce_World
This is a sample application that demonstrates an E-commerce website using the MEAN stack. The application loads products a MongoDB database and displays them. Users can select to display products in a single category. Users can click on any product to get more information including pricing, reviews and rating. Users can select items and add them to their shopping cart

# Import Data
I have included a data folder in this repo. Inside that folder will be 2 folders called cart and item. These 2 folders contain a mongodump of the 2 collections that I use in this ecommerce demo. You can use the import-data.sh script to import these 2 dumps to an ecommerce database, then you will have the same content that I have for this demo.

# Install dependencies with this command:
npm install

# Run the application with this command:
 npm start
